abstract: |
  Abstract to be written here. The abstract should not be too long and should provide the reader with a good understanding what you are writing about. Academic papers are not like novels where you keep the reader in suspense. To be effective in getting others to read your paper, be as open and concise about your findings here as possible. Ideally, upon reading your abstract, the reader should feel he / she must read your paper in entirety.

# Introduction \label{Intro}

Grape minds think alike... or do they? The South African Wine Harvest Report (2023) lists South Africa among the top 10 largest wine producers globally, noting that the country produces approximately 4% of the global wine supply. Over R55 billion of the countryâ€™s GDP can be attributed to the wine industry which employs roughly 269 000 workers [@WoSA2023]. 

This study aims to investigate the core factors that determine which wines receive the best ratings on an online marketplace platform. The data utilised in this study is a sample drawn from Vivino (follow [this link](https://www.vivino.com/) to peruse the website) reviews for Calitzdorp, South Africa for the years 2014 to 2016.
