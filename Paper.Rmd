# Introduction \label{Introduction}
The South African Wine Harvest Report (2023) lists South Africa among the top 10 largest wine producers globally, noting that the country produces approximately 4% of the global wine supply. Over R55 billion of the countryâ€™s GDP can be attributed to the wine industry which employs roughly 269 000 workers [@WoSA2023]. 

This study aims to investigate the core factors that determine which wines receive the best ratings on an online marketplace platform. The data utilised in this study is a sample drawn from Vivino reviews for Calitzdorp, South Africa for the years 2014 to 2016.  

original sample: 2298 observations of 107 variables
