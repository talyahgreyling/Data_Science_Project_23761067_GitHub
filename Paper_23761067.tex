\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

\label{Intro}

Grape minds think alike\ldots{} or do they? The objective of this study
is to investigate which words (if any) used in wine reviews are
associated with higher wine ratings on an online marketplace platform.
The data utilised in this study is a sample drawn from Vivino
\footnote{\emph{follow \href{https://www.vivino.com/}{this link} to
  peruse the website}} reviews for Calitzdorp, South Africa for the
years 2014 to 2016. Section \ref{LitRev} contains a review of the
existing literature surrounding sentiment and, more specifically, wine
descriptives. Thereafter section \ref{Data} explains how the data was
cleaned and transformed and embarks on an exploratory description and
analysis of the data through histograms and word clouds. In section
\ref{StatMod} statistical modelling is employed in a two-step process
consisting of a Random Forest variable selection method and an OLS
(Ordinary Least Squares) regression to determine which words used in
wine reviews are the best predictors of good ratings. Thereafter a
conclusion is drawn in section \ref{Concl}.

\newpage

\section{Literature review}\label{literature-review}

\label{LitRev}

\subsection{Economic importance}\label{economic-importance}

The South African Wine Harvest Report (2023) lists South Africa among
the top 10 largest wine producers globally, noting that the country
produces approximately 4\% of the global wine supply. Additionally, over
R55 billion of the country's GDP can be attributed to the wine industry
which employs roughly 269 000 workers (\citeproc{ref-WoSA2023}{Wines of
South Africa (WoSA), 2023}). The Economic importance of this research
question therefore lies in understanding which key themes, categories or
experiences drive good ratings to enable wine producers to use these
metrics to improve their product and by extension better the country's
GDP and employment (if the boost in ratings and income generated is
significant enough).

\subsection{Sentiment analysis}\label{sentiment-analysis}

Ali, Farooq, Imran \& El Hindi (\citeproc{ref-AliEtAl2025}{2025})
describes sentiment analysis as the undertaking of determining the
opinions and emotions conveyed via text and other media. This has a
multitude of applications in our increasingly technologically driven
society in the domains of e-commerce and marketing, social media,
politics and health. With the explosion of text based content during the
fourth industrial revolution, Dang, Moreno-García \& Prieta
(\citeproc{ref-DangEtAl2021}{in press}) explain that a vast amount of
opposing representations of anything ranging from facts to opinions can
be found online. This gives sentiment analysis an important role to play
in deciphering this new technological landscape we find ourselves in.
Alalwan (\citeproc{ref-AlalwanEtAl2018}{2018}) note that utilising data
mining tools and social media analytics have indeed given businesses
invaluable insight into the preferences, attitudes and behaviour of
their customers.

However, these online platforms where individuals have the freedom to
write whatever and however they deem fit are equally hazardous as they
can facilitate the spread of incorrect information. Vosoughi, Roy \&
Aral (\citeproc{ref-VosoughiEtAl2018}{2018}) found incorrect information
to actually spread wider and faster on social media than its true
counterpart. Nevertheless, these platforms form an integral part of
sentiment analysis since they provide an ever changing source of data
that is becoming more complex and connected by the day
(\citeproc{ref-DangEtAl2021}{Dang \emph{et al.}, in press}).

Vivino is predominantly an online marketplace, but can also be
considered as a social media platform of sorts. The mechanics of the
site's interface and features, to a large extent, mirror those of any
standard social media platform. Vivino users create a profile with an
accompanying profile picture and are able to follow and therefore be
followed by other users. Furthermore, users are able to post images
alongside their wine reviews, which other users can then like, comment
on or share at their own discretion. The reviews shared on Vivino are
therefore subject to the same emotional and behavioural biases as social
media posts which means that value can be added to understanding the
inner workings of this platform's data by applying sentiment analysis
techniques.

\subsection{Wine descriptives}\label{wine-descriptives}

Sentiment analysis has proven to be a useful tool to analyse the wine
industry before. Previous accounts include the study done by Barbierato,
Bernetti \& Capecchi (\citeproc{ref-BarbieratoEtAl2022}{2022}), who used
reviews on packaged wine tour experiences extracted from TripAdvisor, an
online travel review website, to identify the themes present in wine
tourism experiences and separate them into positive or negative bins
based on their sentiment. They also established the elements defining
users' perceptions of quality to understand how wine tourists value the
different features of the wine landscape.

Bangwayo-Skeete \& Skeete (\citeproc{ref-Bangwayo2025S}{2025}) also drew
on data from TripAdvisor to analyse sentiment by focusing on user's
online discussions regarding two US wine festivals (yet another element
of wine tourism) to identify the usefulness of topics \& emotions in
guiding the purchasing behaviour of future users.

Another wine related sentiment study, done by Rui, Sparacino, Merlino,
Brun, Massaglia \& Blanc (\citeproc{ref-RuiEtAl2025}{in press}), aims to
bridge the gap in comprehending post-purchase satisfaction within wine
e-commerce by analysing consumers' feedback in prominent markets located
in the US, UK and China. Using text mining they find differences, by
market in consumers' online wine shopping preferences and aversions and
provide a guide that producers and platforms alike can utilise to
improve their sales and services.

\section{Exploratory data description \&
analysis}\label{exploratory-data-description-analysis}

\label{Data}

\subsection{Data, transformation and
cleaning}\label{data-transformation-and-cleaning}

The data set utilised in this analysis comprises 2298 observations of
107 variables, each encapsulating aspects and features related to the
user, vintage of wine and winery concerned in each review. An excerpt
from the original data set can be found in Table 1. This is supplemented
by Table 2 which displays a description for each of the variables
extracted for use in this analysis.

The original data set was modified slightly by filtering out all reviews
posted in languages other than English since using APIs to translate
them to English was too costly an endeavor to undertake. 1667 of the
original observations remained.

The reviews were tokenized and 30 800 tokens were recorded where-after I
followed the standard pre-processing steps of removing punctuation,
numbers, symbols, characters and taking everything to lower case. I also
used the default tidyverse stop\_words data set to remove stop words
using 3 respective lexicons: snowball (from the tm package), onix (from
the ONIX text retrieval system) and smart (from the SMART information
retrieval system). After these intermediate steps there were 16 869
tokens remaining. All `clean' tokes were ultimately used in the Random
Forest model to avoid unnecessary sampling bias.

\subsection{Data Exploration}\label{data-exploration}

First, I was interested in uncovering the distribution of ratings
associated with review tokens. This was done by calculating the average
rating associated with each unique token and visualising the frequency
observed for each rating through the histogram presented in Figure 1.
The high frequency of observations that can be seen at a rating of 3.5
and 4 suggest that there may be certain words driving better ratings.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{writeup/fig1} \caption{Histogram of average ratings of review tokens}\label{fig:fig1}
\end{figure}

To gain a bit of insight into which words these might be I created a
popularity index that used the formula stated in equation 3.1 to
determine the popularity of each token.

\begin{equation}
    \text{popularity\_index} = 0.8 \times \text{word\_count} + 0.2 \times \text{ave\_rating}
\end{equation}

The most popular words (i.e.~words that get high ratings and are used
frequently) in reviews based on my index can be seen in the word cloud
depicted in Figure 2. It comes as no surprise that wine is the most
`popular' word in a collection of wine review data. The words to take
notice of however are port, dark, nose, sweet and red. It is interesting
to note that 4/5 of these most popular words seem best suited to
describing red, instead of white wines.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{writeup/fig2} \caption{Word cloud of popular words in reviews based on popularity index}\label{fig:fig2}
\end{figure}

The wide difference in importance of tokens as portrayed by both Figures
1 \& 2 were of a large enough extent to merit the statistical modelling
in the next section.

\newpage

\section{Statistical modelling}\label{statistical-modelling}

\label{StatMod} To uncover the underlying relationship between words
used in wine reviews and high ratings a two-step statistical modelling
process was employed.

\subsection{Step 1: Random Forest}\label{step-1-random-forest}

The first step entailed utilising a Random Forest model as a method to
select the 20 review-words (or `variables') that best predicted a high
rating. This model was chosen for its ability to handle complex data
sets effectively as well as its scope for completing classification and
regression tasks in a manner that is easy to interpret.

To employ step 1 the tokenized data was first converted into a document
term matrix of words each re-linked to their respective ratings.
Thereafter I partitioned the data set into two subsets for training and
testing. I decided to adopt the most generally used splitting practice
and divide the data by means of a 70/30 split, whereby the 70\% of the
data is used as the training set and the other 30\% of the data is saved
for testing. By employing this split a healthy balance was maintained
between availing a sufficient amount of data to effectively train the
model and keeping a significant portion of the data unseen to enable
assessing how the model performs without the risk of over fitting that
would have been present if the data had been trained and tested on the
same set of data. Figure 3 plots the distribution of ratings found in
respectively the training (red) and the testing (green) sets. These
followed a satisfyingly similar trajectory that enabled me to
confidently continue with my analysis.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{writeup/fig3} \caption{Distribution of training and testing data}\label{fig:fig3}
\end{figure}

The recipe (a set prepossessing pipeline created for the data) was then
defined and set to facilitate 3 transformations: it included a
hot-encoding applied to categorical variables, removed numeric
predictors with zero variance and normalized numeric predictors.

Next, a tree-based model called a Random Forest was specified. This
model utilises numerous trees fit on bootstrapped samples of the data
reserved for training and uses an arbitrary subset of predictors at
every split (see the `mtry' parameter) which then averages the
predictions made by all the trees to reduce variance. This method is
therefore robust to over fitting, can efficiently process interactions
and non-linearities and is insensitive to scaling (by which variables do
not need to be normalized). My regression forest model employs 100 trees
with a minimum of 10 observations in a node pre split.

A workflow containing the recipe and model specification was then built
to improve reproducibility and reduce errors by ensuring that all
transformations were recorded and performed in the correct order. A
5-fold cross-validation approach was employed for model evaluation and
hyper-parameter tuning whereby the training data was divided into 5
parts that were each employed once as the validation set and acted as a
training set in all other instances. This ensured a robust model
performance estimate that doesn't rely on a single split between
training and testing.

Random Forests require minimal hyper-parameter tuning. The most
important parameter to optimise is `mtry' since selecting a value that
is too low will alleviate bias and selecting a number that is too high
will increase variance. I defined a regular grid over values of `mtry'
that were possible between 2 and 18 and tuned the forest with the same
workflow and CV folds as earlier. Figure 4 plots the RMSE (Root Mean
Squared Error) performance of my Random Forest by `mtry.' The model was
tuned to the lowest mean metric value, as displayed at mtry = 16 in
Figure 4, for the best performance.

\begin{figure}[H]
\includegraphics[width=0.8\linewidth]{writeup/fig4} \caption{Random Forest Performance by 'mtry'}\label{fig:fig4}
\end{figure}

The final model was then fit on the full training set with the optimal
hyper-parameters plugged into the workflow and the final models'
performance was evaluated on the test set. The trained model was
inspected and an assessment was carried out on the models' performance
on unseen data. These results are displayed in Table 3. The RMSE
indicates that on average, predictions deviate from actual ratings by
0.64. The R-squared conveys that 12\% of the variation in ratings is
explained by the model and the MAE (Mean Absolute Error) tells us that
the typical absolute error in prediction is around 0.46. The low RMSE
and MAE are both extremely satisfying whilst the low R-squared conveys
disappointing explanatory power.

The top 20 words identified by the Random Forest model were then
visualised in the variable importance plot displayed in Figure 5. As can
be expected descriptive words conveying a positive sentiment like
`excellent', `absolutely', `fantastic', `amazing' and `delicious' made
up our top ranks. Lesser expected words are `smooth' and `port' which
confirm our suspicions from Figure 2 that red wines are better
associated with high ratings than white wines. Furthermore, Figure 6
depicts a word cloud of the top 50 words in reviews identified by the
Random Forest model where further positive descriptives like
`wonderful', `beautiful', `bliss', `brilliant', `elegant' and `stunning'
can be found.

\subsection{Step 2: OLS Regression}\label{step-2-ols-regression}

During the second step ratings were regressed on the top 20 words
identified by the Random Forest model during step 1, to calculate
coefficients and standard errors and inspect the significance of these
words in predicting high ratings. These regression results are
summarised in Table 4 and we can see that, to our satisfaction, most of
the coefficients display with great significance at even the 0\% level.
We see that the probability of receiving a good rating increases by 50\%
when the word `excellent' is used in a review, but reduces by 168\% when
the word `bland' is included. Interestingly, `port' is the only word
describing a vintage that makes it into the top 20 tokens. This once
again hints to an overall preference for red above white wine, but could
also be due to the concentration of wines made in our sample of
Calitzdrop.

Figure 5 portrays a plot of the coefficients such that the playoff
between those words with positive (INSERT COLOUR) and negative (INSERT
COLOUR) effects on ratings can be seen. We note that there is a higher
collection of positive descriptives that increase the probability of a
good rating than those predicting a bad rating. We also note that
negative descriptives have an effect of a greater magnitude in reducing
the probability of a good rating than the positive descriptives have of
increasing a good rating. This can be attributed to humankind's tendency
to display loss aversion where a loss (buying a bad wine) is valued at a
greater magnitude than a gain (buying a good wine) of a similar size.

\newpage

\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusion}

\label{Concl} I therefore find satisfactory evidence that there is
indeed a correlation between the words used to describe wine in reviews
and their subsequent ratings. These findings are significant when
displayed by means of an OLS regression and were created to be robust to
errors by implementing a Random Forest model to identify which words to
include as explanatory variables. As expected, positive descriptives
have a positive effect on ratings and vice versa for negative
descriptives. The effect of negative descriptives is found to be of a
larger magnitude than those of their positive counterparts and this is
attributed to loss aversion. Wine producers should therefore place a
larger emphasis on shying away from words that are associated with
negative reviews than on striving to achieve those associated with
positive reviews in order to optimise their sales.
